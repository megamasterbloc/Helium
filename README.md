## About

helium is a fork of Upsilon with (or without) new features. It is intended to be a playground for me to practice on rather than an actual prod project.
<br>
## Installation

### Manual

*As of today, only the manual installation is available. You can refer to this [website](https://www.numworks.com/resources/engineering/software/build/) for the first step if you get errors.*



### 1. Install SDK

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>1.1 Linux</b></summary>

<br>


<details>
<summary>Debian or Ubuntu</summary>

<br>

You just have to install dependencies by running these command with superuser privileges in a Terminal:

```bash
apt-get install build-essential git imagemagick libx11-dev libxext-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev pkg-config gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi
```

And there you can go to step 2!

<br>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fedora</summary>

<br>

First install basics dev tools.

```bash
dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel
```

Then install required packages.

```bash
dnf install git ImageMagick libX11-devel libXext-devel freetype-devel libpng-devel libjpeg-devel pkg-config
```

Then, install GCC cross compiler for ARM.

```bash
dnf install arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs-c++
```

<br>

</details>

<br>

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>1.2 Mac</b></summary>

<br>

It's recommended to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once it's installed, just run:
```bash
brew install numworks/tap/epsilon-sdk
```
and it will install all dependencies.

<br>

And there you can go to step 2!

<br>



</details>

<details>
<summary><b>1.3 Windows</b></summary>

<br>

[Msys2](https://www.msys2.org/) environment is recommended to get most of the required tools on Windows easily. It's where you'll paste all the commands of this tutorial. Once it's installed, paste these commands into the Msys2 terminal.

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-freetype mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb git make python
echo "export PATH=/mingw64/bin:$PATH" >> .bashrc
```

Next, you'll need to install the [GCC toolchain for ARM](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads). When prompted for an install location, choose `C:\msys64\home\User\gcc-arm\`. You'll then need to add this folder to your $PATH. Just enter:

```bash
echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/gcc-arm/bin" >> .bashrc
```
Just restart and you can go to step 2!
</details>

<br>

### 2. Set up repo


Clone repo and use 'xi-dev' branch by pasting these two commands:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Trixciel/Xi.git
cd Xi
git checkout xi-dev
```
<br>


### 3. Choose the target


<details>
  <summary><b>Model n0100</b></summary>

(note: you can change the `EPSILON_I18N=en` flag to `fr`, `nl`, `pt`, `it`, `de`, `es` or `hu`).

```bash
make MODEL=n0100 clean
make MODEL=n0100 EPSILON_I18N=en OMEGA_USERNAME="{Your name, max 15 characters}" -j4
```

Now, run either:

```bash
make MODEL=n0100 epsilon_flash
```
to directly flash the calculator after pressing simultaneously `reset` and `6` buttons and pluging in.

<br>

or:

```bash
make MODEL=n0100 OMEGA_USERNAME="" binpack -j4
```
to make binpack wich you can flash to the caculator from [Ti-planet's webDFU](https://ti-planet.github.io/webdfu_numworks/n0100/).
Basically, binpacks lets everyone that can access the numworks webdfu install Xi, which you don't really want to do but eh, whatever.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Model n0110</b></summary>


```bash
make clean
make OMEGA_USERNAME="{Your name, max 15 characters}" -j4
```

Now, run either:

```bash
make epsilon_flash
```
to directly flash the calculator after pressing simultaneously `reset` and `6` buttons and pluging in.

<br>

or:

```bash
make OMEGA_USERNAME="" binpack -j4
```
to make binpack wich you can flash to the caculator from [Ti-planet's webDFU](https://ti-planet.github.io/webdfu_numworks/n0110/).
Basically, binpacks lets everyone that can access the numworks webdfu install Xi, which you don't really want to do but eh, whatever.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Web simulator</b></summary>
  
First, install emsdk :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
./emsdk install latest-fastcomp
./emsdk activate latest-fastcomp
source emsdk_env.sh
```

Then, compile Xi :

```bash
make clean
make PLATFORM=simulator TARGET=web OMEGA_USERNAME="{Your name, max 15 characters}" -j4
```

The simulator is now in `output/release/simulator/web/simulator.zip`


</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>3DS Simulator</b></summary>
  
You need devkitPro and devkitARM installed and in your path (instructions [here](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started))

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Trixciel/Xi.git
cd Xi
git checkout --recursive xi-dev
make PLATFORM=simulator TARGET=3ds -j
```
You can then put epsilon.3dsx on a SD card to run it from the HBC or use 3dslink to launch it over the network:

```bash
3dslink output/release/simulator/3ds/epsilon.3dsx -a <3DS' IP ADDRESS>
```

</details>

<br>

Important: Don't forget the `--recursive` tag, because Upsilon relies on submodules.
Also, you can change the number of processes that run in parallel during the build by changing the value of the `-j` flag.
Don't forget to put your pseudo instead of `{your pseudo, max 15 char}`. If you don't want one, just remove the `OMEGA_USERNAME=""` argument.

## About Epsilon

Xi is a fork of Upsilon, that aims to create a few useful features for students in higher studies.
  
Upsilon is a fork of Omega, after the project's discontinuation.

Omega is a fork of Epsilon, a high-performance graphing calculator operating system. It includes eight apps that cover the high school mathematics curriculum.

You can try Epsilon straight from your browser in the [online simulator](https://www.numworks.com/simulator/).

## Special Thanks
  
Thanks to the entire Omega and Upsilon community from introducing me to the world of Numworks OS creation.
Also thanks to Laury, because this readme is just Upsilon's with a thing or two switched.
